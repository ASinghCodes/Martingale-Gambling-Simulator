# Simple Gambling Simulator (Martingale Strategy)

## Project Overview  
This project involved developing a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate a real-world betting strategy used by Professor Balch for American roulette. The simulation applied the Martingale betting scheme to assess how the strategy performs across thousands of betting episodes, under both ideal conditions and realistic constraints. This project highlights the power of simulation and data analysis in testing probabilistic systems and understanding risk.

**Languages/Tools Used:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Key Concepts:** Probability, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, Risk Modeling

## Project Objectives
- Simulate a widely-known gambling strategy (Martingale) in a statistically sound environment  
- Visualize and analyze outcomes to measure performance, volatility, and risk  
- Compare ideal scenarios (unlimited bankroll) with realistic constraints (limited bankroll) to evaluate real-world feasibility

---

## Technical Highlights
- Built a reusable Python module (`martingale.py`) structured for clarity and extensibility  
- Tracked all betting outcomes using NumPy arrays for efficient computation of statistical metrics  
- Used Matplotlib to generate clean, consistent charts with labeled axes, legends, and standardized ranges  
- Included population standard deviation in all performance graphs for rigorous statistical insight  
- Ensured experiment reproducibility using a deterministic random seed

---

## Value & Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience applying statistical methods to real-world inspired problems  
- Learned to simulate and analyze systems where risk and reward are tightly coupled  
- Strengthened Python skills in modular design, data processing, and visualization  
- Demonstrated ability to present technical findings in a format accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Repository Access  
Due to academic policy, the full implementation—including source code, generated figures, and simulation data—is stored in a private GitHub repository. **Access is available upon request.**
